# Law-Dataset-for-AI
This repository contains datasets for AI training created by the Brazilian Supreme Court cases from 2018 to 2019.

The law book is the file "PontesdeMiranda01.db", which is a cleaned version of the book writted by Pontes de Miranda "Tratado de Direito Civil - Tomo 1".

The file "STF20192018.db" represents all the court cases (board decisions) from 2018 to 2019 extracted with data mining from the Brazilian Supreme Court website.

There are some Python scripts used to create and merge the files.
